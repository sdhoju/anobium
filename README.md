# Lost &amp; Found Mobile application
Lost & Found is a free to use digital app that gives college students a gateway to report missing or misplaced items as well as items that are found on a local campus. It can be used with and without registering. Unregistered users can view the descriptions of lost and found items. To have more functionality registration is required.
